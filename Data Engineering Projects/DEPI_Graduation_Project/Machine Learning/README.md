# Key Features

## 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleans and prepares the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, handling duplicates, and managing missing values.

## 2. Correlation Analysis
- Visualizes relationships between different features and the target variable using a correlation heatmap.

## 3. Model Selection
- Implements **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** with an **RBF (Radial Basis Function)** kernel for regression tasks.

## 4. Feature Scaling
- Standardizes features to enhance the performance of the SVR model.

## 5. Performance Evaluation
- Evaluates the model's performance using **R-squared scores** and visualizes actual vs. predicted values with scatter plots.

## 6. Visualization
- Provides graphical representations of results to easily interpret the model's predictions compared to actual data.
