# Project Overview

This project focuses on improving the operational efficiency of a manufacturing plant by implementing data engineering, data analysis, and machine learning solutions. It leverages real-time data, predictive analytics, and advanced machine learning models to monitor production quality and equipment performance, optimize processes, and reduce costs.

## 1. Data Engineering

The data engineering component is responsible for setting up a robust infrastructure to collect, store, and process data from factory systems. Using Microsoft Azure technologies, unstructured data is stored in an **Azure Data Lake**, structured data is organized and analyzed in **Azure Synapse Analytics (Data Warehouse)**, and automated ETL processes are managed by **Azure Data Factory**. This system ensures efficient data management, supports real-time analysis, and integrates smoothly with other components to provide a comprehensive view of production quality.

## 2. Data Analysis

Data analysis plays a key role in this project by visualizing production performance and enabling actionable insights. Interactive dashboards created with **Power BI** display real-time analytics and performance data. By using a combination of data from the **Data Lake** and **Data Warehouse**, the analysis highlights potential issues in production quality and equipment performance. This helps in waste reduction, optimizing equipment efficiency, and preventing unexpected breakdowns through data-driven preventive maintenance.

## 3. Machine Learning

Machine learning is at the core of the projectâ€™s predictive capabilities. Using **Azure Machine Learning**, predictive models are built to detect patterns in production data and forecast potential equipment failures or defects in product quality. **Azure DevOps** is used to ensure continuous integration and improvement of these models, with **MLOps** monitoring their performance. This proactive approach enhances product quality, reduces costs, and improves operational efficiency.
