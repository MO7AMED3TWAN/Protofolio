## 🧠 Model Structure

The project uses a basic neural network for text classification, including:

- **Text Vectorization:** Converts text data into numerical format using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- **Neural Network:** A simple feedforward neural network that processes vectorized text to classify news articles.

### Key Components:
- **Text Vectorization:** To transform text data into a format suitable for neural network processing.
- **Neural Network Layers:** To learn patterns and make predictions based on the vectorized text.
