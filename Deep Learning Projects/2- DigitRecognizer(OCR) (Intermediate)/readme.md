# 📝 Handwritten Character Recognition using Deep Learning

Welcome to the **Handwritten Character Recognition** project! This repository is dedicated to developing a deep learning model that recognizes handwritten characters and converts them into readable text. Utilizing advanced neural network techniques, this project aims to achieve high accuracy in character recognition.

## 📜 Project Overview

The Handwritten Character Recognition project focuses on building a deep learning model that can accurately identify and transcribe handwritten characters. The model is trained using the MNIST dataset, a well-known benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition. 

### 🧠 Why MNIST?
The MNIST dataset, detailed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), is widely used for training image processing systems. It contains thousands of images of handwritten digits, which are ideal for developing and testing character recognition models.

## 🧠 Model Structure

The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform character recognition. The model architecture includes:

- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features from input images.
- **Max-Pooling Layers:** Reduce dimensionality and enhance feature extraction.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Classify features into character categories.

### Key Components:
- **Convolutional Layers:** For detecting patterns and features in images.
- **Max-Pooling Layers:** To simplify the feature maps and reduce computation.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** To map the extracted features to character classes.

## ⚙️ Installation

To set up the Handwritten Character Recognition project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
