# Fake News Classifier Using Nlp Techniques

## Project Overview: 
This project focuses on creating a Fake News Classifier using a systematic workflow. <br>It involves problem definition, data collection, and preprocessing with tokenization, lowercase conversion, stopwords removal, and lemmatization. <br>The textual data is then transformed into vectors using techniques like Bag of Words and TF-IDF. <br>A machine learning model is built, trained, and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics.

## Project Flow:

    C. Remove Punctuation
    D. Stopwords 
    E. Lemmatization

4. Vectorization (Convert Text data into the Vector):
    ŸêA. TF-IDF
   
6. Model Building :
    A. Model Object Initialization
    B. Train and Test Model
   
7. Model Evaluation :
    A. Accuracy Score
    B. Confusition Matrix
    C. Classification Report

8. Model Deployment

9. Prediction on Some Data
