# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction: Data Exploration, Cleaning, and Feature Engineering

## 📜 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, focusing on data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering. The goal is to provide a detailed guide for data analysts and machine learning practitioners to prepare the Titanic dataset for predictive modeling.

## 📁 Project Description

The project includes the following key components:

- **Data Exploration 🧩:** Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships.
- **Data Cleaning 🧹:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Data Visualization 📊:** Creating various plots to visualize data distributions and relationships.

## 📊 Dataset

The Titanic dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. You can download it from the following link:

## 🔍 Key Sections

### 1. Data Exploration

- **Loading the Data 📥:** Importing and inspecting the dataset.
- **Descriptive Statistics 📈:** Generating summary statistics to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- **Initial Data Review 👀:** Displaying a sample of the dataset to get an initial look at the data.

### 2. Data Cleaning

- **Handling Missing Values ❓:** Identifying and addressing missing values in the dataset.
- **Removing Duplicates 🚫:** Checking for and removing any duplicate rows.
- **Ensuring Consistency ✅:** Correcting data types and ensuring consistency across the dataset.

### 3. Data Visualization

- **Distribution of Age 🎂:** Plotting histograms and box plots for the 'Age' feature.
- **Survival Rates by Sex and Pclass 🧑‍🤝‍🧑:** Creating bar plots to compare survival rates.
- **Pair Plot 🔍:** Visualizing relationships between 'Age', 'Fare', and 'Survived'.
- **Combined Count Plot 📊:** Analyzing counts of passengers by class and sex.

### 4. Data Analysis Questions and Answers

- **Survival Rates by Passenger Class 🚂:** Analyzing survival rates across different passenger classes.
- **Age Group Analysis 👶🧓:** Investigating how survival rates vary by age group.
- **Fare Analysis 💵:** Examining the relationship between fare paid and survival rate.
- **Family Aboard Impact 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦:** Assessing whether having family members aboard affects survival rates.
- **Embarked Location 🌍:** Exploring the relationship between embarkation location and survival rate.
