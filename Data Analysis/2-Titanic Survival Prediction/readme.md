# Titanic Survival Prediction: Data Exploration, Cleaning, and Feature Engineering

## Overview

This repository contains a complete analysis of the Titanic dataset, focusing on data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide for data analysts and machine learning practitioners to prepare the Titanic dataset for predictive modeling.

## Project Description

The project includes the following key components:

- **Data Exploration:** Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating various plots to visualize data distributions and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating and transforming features to improve predictive modeling.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. You can download the dataset from the following link:
- [Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

## Key Sections

### 1. Data Exploration

- **Loading the Data:** Importing and inspecting the dataset.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Generating summary statistics to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- **Initial Data Review:** Displaying a sample of the dataset to get an initial look at the data.

### 2. Data Cleaning

- **Handling Missing Values:** Identifying and addressing missing values in the dataset.
- **Removing Duplicates:** Checking for and removing any duplicate rows.
- **Ensuring Consistency:** Correcting data types and ensuring consistency across the dataset.

### 3. Data Visualization

- **Distribution of Age:** Plotting histograms and box plots for the 'Age' feature.
- **Survival Rates by Sex and Pclass:** Creating bar plots to compare survival rates.
- **Pair Plot:** Visualizing relationships between 'Age', 'Fare', and 'Survived'.
- **Combined Count Plot:** Analyzing counts of passengers by class and sex.

### 4. Data Analysis Questions and Answers

- **Survival Rates by Passenger Class:** Analyzing survival rates across different passenger classes.
- **Age Group Analysis:** Investigating how survival rates vary by age group.
- **Fare Analysis:** Examining the relationship between fare paid and survival rate.
- **Family Aboard Impact:** Assessing whether having family members aboard affects survival rates.
- **Embarked Location:** Exploring the relationship between embarkation location and survival rate.

## Requirements

To run the analysis, you need to install the following Python packages.

```txt
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter
```
